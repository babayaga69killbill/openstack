# openstack
| Feature | DevStack 🛠️ | PackStack 📦 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Goal** | **Development and Testing**. Quickly sets up a development environment to test code changes. | **Proof-of-Concept & Small Deployments**. Quick setup of a small, working OpenStack cloud using stable packages. |
| **Target User** | OpenStack **Developers** and active contributors. | OpenStack **Users/Operators** wanting to try it out or set up a small, non-production cloud. |
| **OpenStack Source** | Installs from **latest Git master** branches (development code). | Installs from **stable distribution packages** (e.g., RDO distribution). |
| **Stability** | **Unstable/Ephemeral**. Not intended to persist across reboots; services lack proper init scripts for production use. | **More Stable** than DevStack, suitable for proof-of-concept; services run with proper service management (e.g., `systemd`). |
| **Underlying Tool** | A series of **Bash shell scripts** (`stack.sh`). | Uses **Puppet** modules for configuration and deployment. |
| **Multi-Node Support** | Primarily designed for **single-node/All-in-One** setup, though multi-node is possible for testing. | Supports **single-node** (all-in-one) and **multi-node** deployments. |
| **Supported OS** | Primarily targets **Ubuntu**, but also supports Fedora and RHEL/CentOS. | Primarily targets **RHEL/CentOS** and compatible derivatives (part of the RDO community). |
| **Configuration** | Configuration is done via a `local.conf` file, focusing on developer needs. | Configuration is done via an interactive prompt or an 'answers file' generated by the tool. |

## DevStack
learn internals
modify OpenStack services
quick and temporory environment
development or bug investigation

## PackStack
need more stable lab setup
admin training
closer to real deployment
RHEL/CentOS environment

## DevStack Installation Guide (Ubuntu 22.04/20.04)
### 1. System Requirements

| Requirement | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| OS | Ubuntu 22.04 / 20.04 (recommended) |
| RAM | 8 GB minimum (16 GB preferred) |
| CPU | 4 cores minimum |
| Disk | 30+ GB free |
| User | Non-root **sudo** user |
| Networking | Internet access required |

### 2. Prepare System
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install git -y
sudo apt install python3-dev python3-pip -y
```

Create a non-root `stack` user (DevStack requires it):

```bash
sudo useradd -s /bin/bash -d /opt/stack -m stack
echo "stack ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/stack
```

Switch to stack user:

```bash
sudo su - stack
```
